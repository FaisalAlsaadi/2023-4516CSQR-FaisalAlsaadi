This is the group project for 4516CSQR made by Faisal Al-Saadi.

This project goal is to analyze data from three world population datasets.
The goal is to answer these question:

1- Which continent has the most/least population? (show piechart of world share for each continent)

2- Which continent had the most/least population growth?

3- Which continent has the most/least density?

4- Which continent has the most/least landmass?

5- Which continent has the most/least countries?

6- Which countries have negative growth and what are their count in each continent?

The packages used for the project are: Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, and Microsoft Excel for cleaning.
