This branch contains the visualizations used for this project. I included a .PDF file "Visualization report" containing pictures of the visualizations, as well as an explanation of how I created them. Moreover, the Jupyter Notebook file can be used to reproduce them. 


Note: Because I changed the text to some visualizations to a white color it might be hard to read. I did this so that the colors will go better with the Powerpoint presentation. The .PDF file has a dark background and it will be easier to see them there.
