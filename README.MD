This is the group project for 4516CSQR made by Faisal Al-Saadi.

This project goal is to analyze data from three world population datasets.
The goal is to answer these question:

1- Which continent has the most/least population? (show piechart of world share for each continent)

2- Which continent had the most/least population growth?

3- Which continent has the most/least density?

4- Which continent has the most/least landmass?

5- Which continent has the most/least countries?

6- Which countries have negative growth and what are their count in each continent?

The packages used for the project are: Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, and Microsoft Excel for cleaning.

Datasets source (2020,2021,2022): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/world-population/versions/698?resource=download
                Continent column: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammedtausif/world-population-by-countries

The file "project.ipynb" is the Jupyter Notebook file used to write the program. In order to run it, simply load the file in Jupyter Notebook and press (SHIFT+ENTER) starting from the first cell. This will reproduce all the results contained in the findings of the project in the Powerpoint presentation.

The CSV files with years in their are the intial dataset used for the project before cleaning.
The "Countries-Continents-Capitals" file was used to add a continent column to the final dataset.
The 'final.xlsx' file is the final dataset after being cleaned.
For more information on the final analysis see the Powerpoint presentation.
